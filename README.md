## Overview

**CSD Peer Awards 2026** is a full-stack web application designed to let a graduating engineering class crowdsource award titles, nominate classmates, and vote for winners — all in a controlled, authenticated environment. The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **TypeScript**, connected to a **MongoDB Atlas** cloud database.

The system is designed for exactly **~62 users** and is not intended for public access. All users are pre-seeded by the admin via a CSV upload — no public registration is permitted.

---

## 👥 User Roles

The system has two distinct user types:

### 🎓 Student
- Authenticated via USN + OTP (sent to official college email)
- Can suggest award titles
- Can upvote or downvote suggested titles (once per title)
- Can nominate one classmate per title (including self-nomination)
- Can update their nomination for a title
- Can vote for one finalist per title during final voting

### 🛡️ Admin (You)
- Full control over the system
- Seeds users via CSV upload
- Approves or rejects suggested titles
- Creates, edits, and soft-deletes titles manually
- Views all nominations and top nominees per title
- Freezes/finalises nominees before final voting begins
- Manages system phase (controls which phase is active)
- Has access to a dedicated admin dashboard API

---

## 🔄 System Phases

The application operates in **three sequential phases**, controlled by the admin via the `system_config` collection:

### Phase 1 — Title Creation 🏷️
> Students suggest award categories. Other students upvote or downvote submissions. The admin reviews and approves titles before they go live.

- Students submit title suggestions (e.g., *"Funniest Person"*, *"Silent Killer"*, *"Most Likely to be CEO"*)
- Duplicate titles (case-insensitive) are rejected at the API level
- Titles remain in `pending` status until admin approves them
- Only `approved` + `isActive: true` titles appear on the public listing
- Admin can reject, update, or soft-delete any title at any time

### Phase 2 — Nominations 🗳️
> Students nominate one classmate per approved title. The system aggregates nominations and the admin can view the top 6 nominees per title.

- One nomination per user per title (enforced by unique DB index)
- Self-nomination is allowed
- Users can update their nominee for a title at any time during this phase
- Admin can view a fully populated leaderboard of top 6 nominees per title
- Admin finalises nominees to lock the phase and prepare for final voting

### Phase 3 — Final Voting 🏅
> Students vote for one finalist per title. After the deadline, the admin reveals results.

- Only the top 6 shortlisted nominees per title are eligible
- One vote per user per title (enforced by unique DB index)
- Votes are locked after submission (no editing)
- After voting closes, the admin triggers result announcement

### Phase 4 — Results Announcement 🎉
> Winners are publicly displayed with vote counts and rankings.

## 🗄️ Database Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | All students and admin (pre-seeded) |
| `otps` | Temporary OTP sessions with expiry |
| `titles` | Award category suggestions |
| `titlevotes` | Upvote / downvote records per title |
| `nominations` | Nomination records (1 per user per title) |
| `finalvotes` | Final voting records (Phase 3) |
| `system_config` | Current phase and global app settings |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

This system uses **OTP-based authentication** — no passwords, no registration.

```
Step 1: Student enters their University Seat Number (USN)
         ↓
Step 2: Backend finds the user in the pre-seeded database
         ↓
Step 3: A 6-digit OTP is generated and emailed to their official college email
         ↓ (Email is partially masked in the response, e.g. "deepa***@college.edu")
Step 4: Student enters the OTP
         ↓
Step 5: Backend validates OTP (5-minute expiry window)
         ↓
Step 6: JWT token issued → used for all subsequent authenticated requests
```

> **Why this approach?** It prevents impersonation (no one can guess another's OTP), eliminates password management, and leverages the college's official email infrastructure for identity verification.

  }
}
```

---

### 🔐 Auth — `/api/auth`

## 🏥 Health Check

The root endpoint (`/`) provides comprehensive server health information including:

- **Server Status**: Node.js version, platform, memory usage
- **Database Status**: MongoDB connection and available collections
- **System State**: Current phase and voting status
- **API Information**: Version and available endpoints

**Usage:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

**Response (Healthy):**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-13T20:23:12.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- npm
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster
- A Gmail account with [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) enabled

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csd-peer-awards-2026-backend.git
cd csd-peer-awards-2026-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in values (see Environment Variables section)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/csd-awards
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here

# Email Configuration (for OTP sending)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
```

### Email Setup Instructions

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account
2. Generate an **App Password** at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the generated 16-character password as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
4. Set `EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail`

**For other email providers:**
- Set `EMAIL_SERVICE` to your provider (e.g., `outlook`, `yahoo`, `sendgrid`)
- Or configure custom SMTP in `src/utils/mailer.ts`

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file.** It is listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## 📜 Scripts

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

---

## 📬 Testing with Postman

1. Import all endpoints into a Postman Collection
2. Set a collection variable: `BASE_URL = http://localhost:5000`
3. After login, set: `TOKEN = <jwt from verify-otp response>`
4. Use `Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}` header on protected routes

> Recommended test order: Upload CSV → Send OTP → Verify OTP → Create Title → Admin Approve → Vote → Nominate → Admin view Top Nominees

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **OTP Security**: OTPs are hashed using bcrypt before storage and never stored in plain text
- **OTP Expiration**: OTPs expire after **5 minutes** and are automatically deleted after verification
- **JWT Security**: JWTs expire after **1 day**
- **Admin Protection**: All admin routes are protected by both `authMiddleware` and `adminMiddleware`
- **Vote/Nomination Integrity**: Duplicate votes and nominations are prevented at both application and database index level
- **Data Auditability**: Titles are soft-deleted (not permanently removed) to preserve audit integrity
- **Email Validation**: OTPs are sent only to registered user emails via secure SMTP

---

## 🗂️ Version Control

- **Git** is used for local version control
- **GitHub** is used as the remote repository
- Recommended branch strategy: `main` (production) + `dev` (active development)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add nomination phase APIs"
git push origin dev
```
